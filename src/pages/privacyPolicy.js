        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your

        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
        process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the

      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform
        technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
        been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that
        practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <h2>11. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
      <p>
        In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted
        specific rights regarding access to your personal information.

        parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all
        third parties with which we shared personal information in the
        immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident
        and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in
        writing to us using the contact information provided below.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a
        registered account with the Apps, you have the right to request removal
        of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Apps. To request removal
        of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided
        below, and include the email address associated with your account and a
        statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is
        not publicly displayed on the Apps, but please be aware that the data
